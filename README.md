The python version of the test code and trained network models (checkpoints) provided here.

How to run:

1- Download the trained network models (checkpoint) for each dataset,

2- Modify the directories to the paths containing the trained model and test data,

3- Specify a path to save the outputs

4- For assessment we used the same Matlab code provided by Sirinukunwattana et al.
